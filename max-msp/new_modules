linear and logarithmic quantizer

delay

weird karplus

function generator

waveset 1 and 2

trigger (multi clock out)

euclid

pulsar

waveshaper (curve)

sampler (drum machine, live looper, granular)

BUILT but not tested -- sound on sound looper  (when record head is open apply some waveshaping and filtering so that it degrades the older loops over time)

resonator (could look at the feedback delay network from one of the reverbm may e the gigaverb; could take waveguide. Noiseburst for the strum input; knobs determine the degree of influence of the cv input)

envelope follower

degrade bitcrusher

dynamics module (combined waveshaper and env follower)

DONE NOT WORKING - 'kinks': phase flip, rectifier (DC block into abs)

DONE - add bandlimited saw to lfo and vco

-- to do:

- set max audio scheduler crossfader
- set list of operators for menu (organize by category?)
