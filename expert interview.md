IMPORTANT: TEXT/EMAIL HIM PRIOR TO SUBMITTING FINAL VERSION INFORMING HIM OF HOW YOU WILL USE HIS WORDS AND HOW YOU WILL ATTRIBUTE HIM. expert questions:

modalitiies of interaction

perceptual integration and mapping:
- spatialisation. 

- the traditiional stereo setup is quite limiting. 

- he has a 16 channel monitor mixer. (but is it mixed down to stereo?)
- would be 

ergonomics: 
  - no problem standing. he'd be fine with sitting. 

  "the tilt of the module layout is really ideal. havng the amount of space in the world. beng able to tilt the modules around oneself is very useful. concave around yourself. you can look up and its at the right angle for your gaze."

- knobs are not having a discernable effect on the parameters. not sure why. 
- knob doesn't have same effect as signal input. 

- oscilloscope would be great! 
  - having callibraton of the osclloscope would be ideal as well. 

- he's happy to come try out another version of MSVR (once we push some better versions)

"interesting paradigm of throwing the modules in the trash by sendinig them through the floor"

'how to know what a module is/does?' (i.e. tooltips, reference pages?)

vr-speciific:

evaluation of cybersickness
- nothing. however the system did crash a few times and he experienced purgatory

## virtual body
- sense of self. 
  - is in the vr world, feels themselves on the carpet
    - finds it awkward when they bump into the phsyical cord. i suggested he relocate himself to centre of alice lab. that helped. (but the point i think is that he's immersed enough in the vr world that collision with phsyical world is interrupting)
- q: do you need to see yourself, your hands?
  - siince he's holding controllers he may as well see controllers. 
  - but he's much more focused on the raycast location and tip. 


"i can see how it could be convenient to have a module and push it off to the side. that would be an advantage to this system." (refering to pulling a module directly in front of you to work on and tweak, then move it somewhere further afield.)
- 
representation and ownership

expert playability of the synth
  - could he see himself playing the same thing again? this is a curious one again for modular synths (depending on the player)

presence: feeling of 'being there'
plausibility: the sensation that what is seen/heard is actually happening (curious one for MS)

engagement: ability to keep the player interested in playing the instrument. 

agency: "A relevant element for VMIs is the concept of agency, e.g., the ability to take meaningful actions and see the results of oneâ€™s decisions and choices"
latency of interaction

outs not indicative of being an output. 
unclear indication of signal flow, particularly for the output module. would be great to trace a signal from endpoint up to inital source. 

when he looks at a new system (i.e. modular), he first asks "where is the final output of the system that goes straight to the amplifier, or front-of-house?" this is not clear with the outs module. its a mystery to know what else to connect the outs to. how are you outputs going to the system? 

nothing to indicate what to plug into the outs in order to get a sound (this is where the visual feedback is necessary)


knob turning jumps to current hand position still


methods to asses the user experience without interrupting him (i.e. i was chatting with him while he was playing) would be a significant step forward (we can mention this in the paper as a 2.0 step)


i noticed he tried to bring a module into a cable. in other words can a module be manipulated in space such that it docks with a suspended cable?

me "the bi-manual control of Hardware MS defined as knob turning/twiddling, switches, buttons, etc, and *plugging/unpluggin cables ('this he identified as half the fun of the synth')*. i asked him how that compares to using the vive controllers: 
"your aim has to be really good when pluggin in. he finds he gets a lot of spurious cables. he finds he gets a spurious cable when he intended to manipulate an existing one."

not always obvious to him when the cable connection was made. 

manual dexterity is better physically than with the controllers. is open to there being a learning curve. once he figures out the 

hardest thing is turning the knobs: only the sweeping motions effective, the turning knobs with one's wrist (the intuitive action) is not presenting as effective. 

- this was his first time wearing a vr headset

i started to experiment with max patches. a crossfader... being able to crossfade between multiple channels. brought up the *4ms VCA Matrix*. excted about the output module as being able to 

how woud you experience the speakers being placed across the room? 

ts one thng to have modules outputs router to partcular output modules. ts another thng to work wth diffuson withn that arrangement. how would you do live dffusion/mixnig/pannning between the individual outputs? we don't know the answer to that right now (Lawrence's response: this is more of a static setup. i have someone who plays ths instrument 'm gonig to pan iit nito the back speaker; some things i want dffuse, you make the adjustments wth a static setup. i haven't gotten it yet but that *4ms VCA Matrix* is more ideal to being able to do interestiing thngs wth modulating outputs.)[[my response: we don't yet have any matrix switching or matrix modulation modules in our system]]

this is the frst time ini my life i've ever played vr. you buy into the space that you're in at that moment.
