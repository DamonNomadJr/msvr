MENU

is created using the same function that creates geometry etc. of objects in a project, but is not part of the OT workflow

















we have 1 universe, which is our current workspace, that is, the singular actual experience of the app at any time

in this, we can have many worlds (including worlds within worlds), which can be "saved" and "restored"

we also have other things that are not worlds, such as the floor, the UI menu, other people's headsets, etc.

OTs are relative to a specific world. 

Interest in idea of thinking of a world as a distinct server -- and a client can connect to multiple servers accordingly.
